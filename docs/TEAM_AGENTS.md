# DVT Team Agents

This document provides an index of all **dev-team-*** and **test-team-*** sub-agents used in DVT development. Each agent has a specific scope and set of responsibilities.

## Overview

All sub-agents follow these principles:
- **Repository**: Work is done in the DVT repository (`git@github.com:heshamh96/dvt-ce.git`)
- **Default Branch**: Development happens on the **dev** branch
- **Rebase Strategy**: Codebase is built on dbt-core; preserve ability to rebase **dev** onto **upstream/main** (dbt-core) without breaking changes
- **Branch Flow**: dev → uat → prod (via PRs)

## Agent Roster

| Agent ID | Cursor Rule File | Scope | When to Use |
|----------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| **project** | `.cursor/rules/project.mdc` | Global project rules, structure, conventions | Always active - provides project-wide context |

| **dev-team-docs** | `.cursor/rules/dev-team-docs.mdc` | Documentation, `dvt docs` command | When writing documentation, implementing `dvt docs`, or maintaining contributor guides |
| **test-team-data-engineer** | `.cursor/rules/test-team-data-engineer.mdc` | dbt-aligned testing, reference project (Cocacola_DWH_on_DBT), Coke_DB scenario | When testing features with a real dbt reference, verifying dvt init/output matches dbt mindset |
| **test-team-technical-qa** | `.cursor/rules/test-team-technical-qa.mdc` | Paths, names, files, design compliance | When verifying paths, names, and file structure match feature specs and Rule 10 |
| **test-team-negative-tester** | `.cursor/rules/test-team-negative-tester.mdc` | Bad inputs, user errors, robustness | When testing edge cases, invalid inputs, and immunity to user errors |

## How to Use Agents

### For AI Assistants

When working on a specific area, reference the appropriate agent's Cursor rule file. For example:
- Working on federation engine? Use `dev-team-federation` rules
- Writing tests? Use `dev-team-qa` rules
- Implementing CLI commands? Use `dev-team-backend` rules
- Testing with a real dbt project (e.g. dvt init Coke_DB)? Use `test-team-data-engineer` rules
- Verifying paths and file layout? Use `test-team-technical-qa` rules
- Testing bad inputs and edge cases? Use `test-team-negative-tester` rules

### For Human Developers

1. **Identify your task** - Determine which agent's scope your work falls into
2. **Read the agent's rule file** - Check `.cursor/rules/dev-team-<name>.mdc` for specific guidelines
3. **Follow the instructions** - Each agent has specific instructions for their domain
4. **Reference DVT RULES** - All agents reference the canonical DVT RULES from `dvt_implementation_plan.md`

## Agent Responsibilities Summary

- Optimizes query execution (predicate pushdown)
- Translates SQL between dialects
- Manages Spark sessions

### dev-team-adapters

### Test team

#### test-team-data-engineer
- Uses Cocacola_DWH_on_DBT as reference dbt project (postgres flavour)
- Creates and verifies DVT projects (e.g. Coke_DB) for dvt init and related features
- Ensures dbt mindset and profile/layout compatibility; pulls needed files into test fixtures

#### test-team-technical-qa
- Verifies paths (~/.dvt/, project dirs), names, and file contents match design
- Checks idempotency and overwrite behaviour; validates against Rule 10 and feature specs

#### test-team-negative-tester
- Challenges features with invalid project names, paths, CLI usage, and bad state
- Ensures clear, actionable errors and no silent failures; encourages automated negative tests

**Testing Playground**: All test-team agents run their tests under `/Users/hex/Documents/My_Projects/DVT/Testing_Playground`. **Do not remove things.** Each test run uses a **trial folder**: `trial_<what_we_are_testing>_<number>` (e.g. `trial_dvt_init_1`). **Each trial is a self-contained uv project**: the trial has its own uv (pyproject.toml), its own .venv, and dvt-ce installed inside it; you `cd` into the trial and run `uv run dvt ...` there. **Findings** are written in that folder under `findings/`.

**Environment**: Test-team agents use **Python** and **uv**. Each trial must be a **uv-contained folder** with the tool installed inside the trial (e.g. `uv init`, `uv add .../dvt-ce/core`, `uv sync`, then `uv run dvt ...` from the trial)—not a shared env or standalone scripts.

## Important Reminders

1. **Always work on the `dev` branch** - All development happens on `dev`
2. **Respect branch flow** - dev → uat → prod (via PRs)
3. **Preserve rebase compatibility** - Changes must be rebaseable onto dbt-core
4. **Reference DVT RULES** - The canonical rules are in `dvt_implementation_plan.md`
5. **Check feature dependencies** - Review `dvt-ce-features/` before making changes
